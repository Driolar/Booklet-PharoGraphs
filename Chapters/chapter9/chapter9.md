## Matchings (Independent Edge Sets)
In graph theory, a matching or independent edge set in an undirected graph is a set of edges without common vertices. 
The term matching ist more popular, but it shouldn't be confused with another meaning of graph matching that is computing the similarity of graphs (graph isomorphism).

Graph matching problems are very common in daily activities.
From online matchmaking and dating sites, to medical residency placement programs, matching algorithms are used in areas like scheduling, planning, pairing of vertices, and network flows. 
More specifically, matching strategies are very useful in flow network algorithms such as the Edmonds-Karp algorithm.

### Definitions and examples
The *cardinality* of a matching is the number of its edges. In figure 1,
